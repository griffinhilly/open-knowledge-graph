## Phase 6: Quality Review — DONE
- [x] Spot-check prerequisite chains per domain for correctness
  - Longest chains reviewed across all 19 domains (21–147 steps). All pedagogically sound.
- [x] Expert review of highest-connected topics (hubs)
  - Top 5 hubs reviewed (ratios, mean-median-mode, mathematical-induction, percent-concept, partial-derivatives). All confirmed reasonable.
- [x] Identify and fill coverage gaps (thin courses)
  - 24 new topics added across 9 courses. All courses now have 20+ topics.
- [x] Resolve builds-toward consistency warnings (1,609 → 571 → 530)
  - Dialectic-reviewed reconciliation: 31 topics created, 35 IDs merged, 13 cycles removed, 942 same-course + 124 cross-course prereqs added, 411 transitive edges skipped
  - DAG-as-simplification note added to meta/schema.md
- [x] Review bidirectional pairs (75 → 39 → 0)
  - 39 pairs resolved via apply_bidirectional_fixes.py (36 directional, 3 dropped both)
- [x] Shallow content fixed (noun-phrases expanded)
- [x] Move reviewed topics from draft → validated status
  - All 2,628 topics promoted to validated
- [x] Built QA tooling: tools/qa_analyze.py (structural analysis), tools/apply_bidirectional_fixes.py

## Phase 7: Visualization Update — DONE
- [x] Update visualize_hierarchy.py to support multi-domain rendering
  - Auto-generates colors from `_domain.yml` configs, added `--all` flag for batch generation
- [x] Generate per-domain hierarchy visualizations
  - All 19 domains + index page generated via `--all`
- [x] Build full cross-domain graph visualization
  - `visualize_radial.py`: developmental-stage radial bands, curated domain ordering, polar force simulation
  - Two iterations: v1 used topological depth (incorrect), v2 uses developmental stage (correct)
- [x] Build individual topic detail pages
  - `generate_topic_pages.py`: 2,628 pages with Core Idea, prerequisite chains, successors, navigation
- [x] Click-to-navigate between graph views and topic detail pages

## Phase 8: Community Launch
